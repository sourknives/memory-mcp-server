## Pre-Deployment Verification

Before deploying to production, run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Install and test the package
pip install -e .
python -m pytest tests/

# 2. Build and test Docker image
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 3. Run comprehensive tests
python tests/run_comprehensive_tests.py

# 4. Verify security configuration
python -c "from cross_tool_memory.config.security_config import SecurityConfig; print('Security config OK')"

# 5. Test backup and restore
python scripts/backup_restore.py backup --name pre-deployment-test
python scripts/backup_restore.py restore pre-deployment-test
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these items:

- [ ] Health check endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible and functional
- [ ] Database is properly initialized
- [ ] Logging is working and logs are being written
- [ ] Backup procedures are functional
- [ ] Monitoring is collecting metrics
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates are valid (if using HTTPS)

## Production Monitoring

Monitor these metrics in production:

- Response times for API endpoints
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU usage
- Disk space usage
- Error rates and types
- Active connections
- Backup success/failure rates

## Support and Maintenance

- Regular security updates
- Database maintenance and optimization
- Log rotation and cleanup
- Backup verification and testing
- Performance monitoring and optimization
